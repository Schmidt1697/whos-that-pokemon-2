# whos-that-pokemon-2?!
 Based on the original Who's that Pokemon?! Created w/ Justin Saborouh for our Phase 1 project at Flatiron School. This has a slight change and does not use a db.json file or json server. 
 
This is a game where users can guess what pokemon is displayed to see if they're right or wrong!
Correct pokemon get added to the box. The user can also see their best win streak and compare it to their current win streak. The current win streak resets with an incorrect guess.

We accessed a free external api to display random pokemon.
